Safe! is a rewrite of the Commodore PET game originally written by Gary Marsa in 1981 and distributed in CURSOR magazine #26.

You will need to put siren.wav on the SD card.  Either by copying directly to the SD card or by using the 
`XMODEM RECEIVE "siren.wav"
command over the serial connection.

You use the cursor right/left keys to move the combination (1-60) right and left.
The combination is 4 numbers.
The moves are right-left-right-left

Unlike a regular lock, you don't have to do a full rotation on the left move.

You move the combination right until the indicator shows you got the first digit.
Then move left until you get the second number.
Then move right until you get the third number.
And finally move left until you get the fourth number.

If you move right when you should move left, then your crack attempt will be reset and you need to start over.

ex:
Let's say you find the first number.  But you to continue to move right, you no longer have 1 correct.
After you find the first number, you are expected to move left.  If you hit the second number and keep moving left, you now have 0 correct.

No penalty you when you hit the last number - you will immediately win.

The clock starts ticking right away.  You have at least 3 minutes to crack the safe, but maybe up to 9 - it's random.
